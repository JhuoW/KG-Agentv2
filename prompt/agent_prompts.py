# Actor (Navigation Policy) Prompts
# =============================================================================

ACTOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a knowledge graph reasoning agent performing CONSTRAINED graph traversal. Your task is to navigate a knowledge graph step-by-step to find entities that answer a given question.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- You can ONLY select from the provided candidate hops. NO exceptions.
- You CANNOT invent, imagine, or suggest entities/relations not in the candidate list.
- If no candidate seems relevant, you MUST still choose the most promising one OR output "STOP".

At each step, you will see:
1. The natural language question.
2. The reasoning path history (reasoning steps taken so far).
3. A list of VALID next hops in the graph (relations and neighbor entities).

Your goal is to select the hop most likely to lead to the answer, OR to stop if:
- The current entity directly answers the question, OR
- You have reached a dead end with no promising candidates.

DECISION PROCESS:
1. Parse the question to identify what type of entity is being asked for (person, place, time, etc.).
2. Examine each candidate relation - does it semantically lead toward the answer type?
3. If the current entity matches the answer type being asked, output "STOP".
4. Otherwise, select the candidate with the relation most relevant to the question.
5. If multiple candidates seem equally good, prefer shorter relation names (more direct).

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- To stop: "STOP"
- To select action k: "ACTION [k]" where k is the candidate number (1-indexed)

ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES:
- NEVER output an entity name that is not in the candidate list.
- NEVER suggest a relation that is not in the candidate list.
- ONLY use numbers that correspond to valid candidates.
- If unsure, prefer "STOP" over making up information."""

Reasoning Path So Far:

Available Candidate Hops (ONLY choose from these):

RULES:
- ONLY use numbers that appear in the candidate list
- Numbers must be separated by commas
- Include "STOP" if you believe the current entity answers the question

Output format: "3, 1, 5" or "STOP" or "STOP, 2, 4" (numbers in order of preference)"""

AGGREGATOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert knowledge graph reasoner performing GROUNDED answer extraction.

CRITICAL: You can ONLY output answers that appear in the provided reasoning paths.
You CANNOT invent, imagine, or suggest any entity that is not explicitly present in the paths.

Your task is to extract answers from the provided Candidate Reasoning Paths that correctly answer the question.

VERIFICATION PROCESS:
1. Read the Question and identify what TYPE of entity is being asked for (person, place, language, time, etc.).
2. For EACH candidate path, examine:
   a) Which entity in the path matches the TYPE the question asks for?
   b) Is there a relation that semantically connects to what the question asks?
   c) Is the reasoning chain logically valid?
3. ONLY include answers where the path logically supports the answer.

VALIDITY CRITERIA:
- The answer entity must be the TYPE of thing the question asks for.
- The relation leading to the answer must be semantically relevant to the question.

OUTPUT RULES:
- Output the entity that SEMANTICALLY answers the question based on its type.
- The answer is the entity reached via a relation relevant to the question.
- Do NOT output the starting entity unless it genuinely answers the question.
- Do NOT hallucinate or infer entities not present in the paths.
- If NO path validly answers the question, output: "# Answer: NONE, #Reasoning Path: No valid path found"
- For multi-answer questions, include ALL valid distinct answer entities.

Output format (one line per answer):
# Answer: [Entity Name], #Reasoning Path: [Full Path String]"""

3. Select paths where the relation semantically matches the question.
